## My process

I examined both the mobile and desktop design images, identifying similarities in the card markup, then utilizing mobile first approach, I created the html markup and the css styles. I utilized css grid and flexbox to achieve the differing mobile/tablet/desktop layouts.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

As with prior Frontend Mentor challenges, I practiced reviewing design specifications, designing the appropriate markup for a responsive page, and I practiced utilizing flexbox and CSS Grid. Specifically with grid, I practiced working with grid-template-areas / grid-area, and the CSS repeat() function in order to encorporate more modern CSS and make the layout easier to develop compared to classic CSS.
